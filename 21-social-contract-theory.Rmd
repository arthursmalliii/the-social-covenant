# The Enlightenment Concept of *The Social Contract* 

Was the social contract theory that emerged from Locke et al.: Was this
originally meant to be a contract or a covenant? Was it mis-stated?

Rousseau maybe was closer. Concept of "the general will".

Is there such a thing as "a spirit of the people"? 
Are "the people" anything more than a collection of individuals engaged in mutually advantageous transactions? 
Under what conditions would you sacrifice for the greater good of your people?
