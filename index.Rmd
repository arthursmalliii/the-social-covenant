# Foreward {-}

We are living through a breakdown of American political civil society. Enflamed by fears of losing their traditional dominance, and ashamed of losing that dominance to coastal elites, brown people, and immigrants, one-third of the American people are jettisoning democracy and embracing fascism. 

The forces that brought us to this crisis are not recent. They are deeply rooted in American history, and even our pre-history. Finding our way to a healthier America requires looking way back to the ideas and forces that brought us this sickness.

This book is motivated by three questions. How did this happen? How did we get to this place? And perhaps most important: How do we get out of it?
