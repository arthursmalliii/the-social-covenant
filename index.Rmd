# Foreward {-}

There was a Declaration of Independence from the Crown. Led to the Constitution, which worked.

The 2nd... was from slavery: the Emancipation Proclamation.  Led to the Second Founding, which worked partially. 

This work is the third. This work is motivated as a Declaration of Independence from autocracy. 

[We thus elevate the stakes.] We are in such a condition that this work is essentially a third DoI.

[PL: I never read the Em Proc.] This Declaration must convey the same powerful message that are corresponding in their generality and power of their values to the same level of the first two DoIs.

Democracy depends on what we do now. This work is intended as a map of what needs to be done.

We need to make sure that this DoI, and subsequent refounding, works fully.

This is a Declaration about how to organize ourselves with real, inclusive, genuine representative democracy, guided by the values that were already declared from the beginning. 


The Foreward presents the rationale for the 4th founding: hard-hitting, blunt, concise, clear, crisp, powerfully motivating the rationale and general structure for the 4th Founding. 

Reaction we want: "I see the history; I see the current situation; I see the need; I see the goal."

Elements that will contribute to this kind of a document must be clear, concise, punchy, rhythmically-stated.

Culminating in the 4th Founding. 

For each founding:

* What is involved;
* What are the values;

Need parallelism between the first three. Gives credence to the claim we advance that there is a need for the 4th Founding.
