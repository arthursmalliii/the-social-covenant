# (PART) Social Covenants in Scripture and in History {-} 

Part I provides an historical survey of social covenants, and an intellectual history of the concepts of social covenants, social contracts, and constitutions.




## 17th Century: The Pilgrims at Plymoth Rock

On landing in North America, the pilgrims adopt a new social covenant. They explicitly bind themselves together in a new community, distinct from Europe; and articulate the terms of their association as a Christian brotherhood.


# (PART) The Enlightenment Project {-}


# The Enlightenment Concept of *The Social Contract* 

Was the social contract theory that emerged from Locke et al.: Was this
originally meant to be a contract or a covenant? Was it mis-stated?

Rousseau maybe was closer. Concept of "the general will".

Is there such a thing as "a spirit of the people"? 
Are "the people" anything more than a collection of individuals engaged in mutually advantageous transactions? 
Under what conditions would you sacrifice for the greater good of your people?



# Social covenant, social contract, and the U.S. Constitution


# The Breakdown of the Enlightenment Project

The French Revolution leads to the Reign of Terror, leads to Napoleon.

Marx. Materialism. The disastrous experiments of state authoritarian socialism. Soviet, Chinese, etc.

This history requires analysis: how did the Enlightenment promise of governance through human reason lead to such humanity-crushing disaster? 

What were the key errors?




Contrast:
JFK: "Ask what you can do for your country." 
vs Reagan: "Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"

The Republican program since at least 1980 has been a sustained assault on the very idea of community, of the common good.

Claim: A social contract alone cannot bind a nation together. An enduring nation must be bound together by a social covenant. 

And in a truly democratic nation, the terms of the social covenant must be developed collaboratively, not imposed from on high. 


## Black thought on the U.S. social covenant



# (PART) The Enlightened Self {-} 

Part III focuses on the individual human, prior to entering into a social covenant.

# Autonomy, Self-Governance, and Flourishing

In the Enlightenment concept of the self, certain concepts are central:

* *autonomy*, or *self-governance*;
* *reason*;
* Aristotle's concept of *eudaemonia*, translated as *human flourishing*.


Epistemologically, the project adopts an *empirical* approach, based on observation of the senses. 

Revealed truths, declarations based on religious scripture, claims grounded on clerical or political authority, received traditions -- these are not held to be sound bases for the discovery of knowledge about the self.

The Enlightenment applies recently-emerged *scientific method* to questions concerning the means and ends of human life.


## Autonomy

*Autonomy* is a central concept in the Enlightenment concept of the self.

**Autonomy != satisfaction of desire**

Rather, a being with autonomy is *self*-governing.

A being that is governed entirely by its desires and appetites is not self-governing. 
(Ref: Plato's *Republic*.)


## Reason


## Flourishing

A translation of Aristotle's *eudaemonia*, human flourishing is the proper end of human life. It involves the realization of potential.

*Eudaemodia* is *not* the same as "happiness", and certainly not the same as pleasure, or the satisfaction of desire. 

When Jefferson wrote of human's unalienable right to "the pursuit of happiness", *eudaemonia* is what he had in mind.


# Critiques of the Enlightenment Concept of the Self

## Criticisms based on clerical or royal authority


## Criticisms based on scepticism about the efficacy of reason as a guide to human life

The Reign of Terror gave reason a bad name.


# Morality Without God?

## Flourishing, and its relation to the Good

Hume's argument re: "is" and "ought": cannot derive "ought" from "is".

Esp. re: religion: "God commands X; therefore, X ought to be done."

Must add the normative axiom: "God's commands ought to be followed."

G.E. Moore: Introduced the *naturalistic fallacy*. 
Target: utilitarianism. Bentham et al.

If you define "good" = "pleasure", then you assert: meaning of *good* = meaning of *pleasure*.

Then it would make no sense to ask: 
Q: "Is pleasure good?"

But Q is an informative question.
Therefore, good cannot be defined as pleasure.

Called the *open question argument*.

Involves *paradox of analysis*: If you give an analysis, you  give meaning of things in terms of other terms.

But if analysis is only matching conceptual identity, then analysis cannot generate new information. 

Frege: "A = A" is not informative. "A = B" is informative. But 

Leads to *sense-reference distinction*.

Fundamental question: 
Suppose we want to say that *flourishing is good*. 
Can we ask this question?

Could the answer be "No"?
Could we entertain circumstances under which human flourishing is *not* a good thing?

Hypothesis: we cannot say this. 
We cannot imagine *any* conditions under which this is false.

Open Question Argument suggests: "pleasure = good" might be false.

**Assertion: Relationship between "flourishing" and "good" is the same as the relationship between "murder" and "immoral" / "morally unjustified".**

**Claim: Instances of the property of "genuine flourishing" will always be a sub-class of the property of "good".**

Key question: Why is it so difficult to imagine instances of flourishing that are not good?

Look for specific instances: 

When we see flourishing, why is it so hard to reject the assertion that this is good?


## Divine Command Theory 

An intellectual exercise to pull morality back from the Enlightenment ideals -- the authority of reason -- back to a religious foundation.

DCT: Self-interest becomes part of an authoritative hierarchical structure.

Social contract theory based on self-interest inherits the authoritarian structure of self-interests.

### "Huge compromises had to be made"

* The degree to which the financial elite had a huge role in dictating fundamental policies. There was no way to devise the principles that govern the processes that determine policies, without them. They kept, and keep, tilting the balance in their favor.

* Communism tried to uproot the financial people with a new elite. 
  - The problem is *control*, not *ownership*. 
  - How do you distribute the (rewards of) assets so that the rewards flow fairly? 
  
Unless we find a way to find a fair distribution of the wealth from these assets?


## The Problem of Moral Alienation

If we affirm and follow moral laws solely because of commands (God's or anyone's), then we are not truly moral agents. We are a kind of animal.

This problem is one for all systems that are based on a hierarchical authority, where authority relies essentially on self-interested conception of the self and application of rewards and punishments. 

It actually promotes a conception of the self as a self-interested being, a.k.a., *homo economicus*. 

Beef w/ salvation-oriented (salvatic?) religions: it's ultimately based on self-interest.

# (PART) Designing a Social Covenant on Enlightenment Principles {-} 


# Social Contracts, Social Covenants, and Constitutions

## What is a covenant? What is a *social* covenant?

## What is the relationship between a covenant and a contract?

Contracts:

-   are fully dependent on interests
-   are motivated by individual interests of the parties
-   

Covenants:

-   defined by a set of values?

-   not based on mere interest

-   has a notion of the sacred

When you assume individuals have *autonomy*, this precludes the
possibility that any entity (God; Tsar) can have absolute authority.

This why Catholic reconstructionists and Protestant dominionists are making a massive attack on autonomy.


## The role of reason (in the Enlightenment sense) in the discovery of the covenant

Technology will change. Resources, other things will change.


# The Conditions that Support Flourishing

We have been setting up flourishing

... identify the conditions to flourishing, because those conditions then contribute to the good.


## Challenges in Identifying the Conditions that support Flourishing


### Empirical challenges: We can't know


### The design challenge: human flourishing is not uniquely determined

### Evolutionary challenge: Conditions change


# The relationship between the social contract and the social covenant

## Policies are provisional


## The process for revising the social covenant

1.  Human flourishing is the yardstick.
2.  Because of (1), there is some leeway to the modification of the
    elements of the covenant.
3.  The social contract can be modified at higher frequency, with a
    lower threshold. Given changes in conditionsâ€¦
