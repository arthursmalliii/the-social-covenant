Periodic rituals reaffirm the commitment to the community. Always, symbols are used to stand for the community as a whole, and indicate membership in it. (Flags, patches, logos, …) 1.4.3 The terms of the covenant are incomplete The covenant states broad, general principles or values by which the community will live. These values are not stated with legal precision. The statement of principle does not cover all cases of application, and is not intended to. The covenant does not describe the process of governance. It does not state the number of members in representative political bodies, their powers, and the mechanisms of their selection and replacement. Rather, the covenant states objectives and constraints that governance processes must adhere to. 1.5 The U.S. today: A contested covenant A central confusion in the U.S. today concerns the disputed terms of our unwritten social covenant, and confusion over the difference between our covenant and our Constitution. 1.5.1 The U.S. has a de facto social covenant The U.S. has a written social contract: the Constitution. The U.S. has an unwritten social covenant. In fact, more than one. Our social covenant is spread over a few places: The Declaration of Independence. The Preamble to the Constitution. The Bill of Rights. The Pledge of Allegiance. 1.5.2 The social convenant of the U.S. is contested Some basic terms of our social covenant have never been settled. Who is a full member of the community? What are the rights and obligations of community members to one another? What role does religion and religious scripture hold in setting the terms of the covenant – if any? 1.6 The project we undertake in this book Our project in this book is to update social contract theory for the 21st Century and beyond. We argue that before entering into a social contract, a community must first form its social covenant. In Part I, we review concepts and examples of social covenants in scripture and in pre-modern history. These covenants typically involved divine sanction or divine command. In Part II, we review the concept of the social contract, and how it grew out of the philosophical environment of the Enlightenment. We also discuss how, where, and why the political project of the Enlightenment went wrong. (Did it?) Spoiler alert: the mistakes were to lose sight of the sacred and spiritual nature of the covenant, and to lose sight of human flourishing as the only appropriate objective for political arrangements. Starting in Part III, we examine deeply the philosophical foundations of the Enlightenment political project. We focus on the key concepts of autonomy, self-governance, reason, and eudaemonia a.k.a. human flourishing. Part IV discusses the political arrangements that underpin conditions that support human flourishing. It investigates how the social covenant relates to the social contract and to the constitution. In Part V, we propose a new social covenant for the United States. We offer proposed text, and describe the form of ritual ceremony in which it would be adopted, proclaimed, and affirmed.

(What is the Hebrew count-part to “dominion”? What are the nuances in the Hebrew that “dominion” doesn’t capture? “Stewardship” implies authority plus responsibility, and limitation on ownership.) 2.1.2 The second creation story God blows the spirit into Adam. The creation covenant: a shared spiritual essence. Provides to all humanity an equal spiritual basis. (Makes baptism unnecessary?) Shared responsibility between humanity and God to maintain and secure conditions necessary for all living beings to survive and flourish. Beginning of human moral agency. 2.2 The covenant with Noah A covenant with all of creation. Shared responsibility between humanity and God to maintain and secure conditions necessary for all living beings to survive and flourish. 2.3 The Mosaic covenant A covenant specifically with the Jewish people. 2.4 Jesus and the Last Supper “It shall be for you a new and everlasting covenant…” 2.5 Common features of divine covenants The covenant creates a new tribe, community, or nation. By participating in the covenant, a collection of individuals forms a new tribe - bound together with reciprocal ties of loyalty, responsibility, claims and obligations. *The terms of the covenant define the social compact for the new tribe. Entering into the covenant changes the individual participants fundamentally. The act of joining the tribe is also a event of individual re-birth. It changes who you are. God sets the terms. The asymmetry in power between God and man is absolute. Because God sets the terms entirely, the covenant cannot really be called a contract. A contract is a voluntary agreement between parties that seeks to advance mutual interest. Even if one party entirely sets the terms, others have the option to decline. In all the biblical covenant stories, there is no sense whatsoever that man has any leverage, any option of refusal. The Covenant is God’s gift, and God’s command, framed entirely on God’s terms. It’s not even a take-it-or-leave-it offer: there is no genuine option to leave-it, that one can discern. (There are other biblical stories that do involve bargaining with the divine, e.g., in the story of Sodom and Gommorah “What if I can find just ten righteous men?”, or Satan’s bargaining with God over the fate of Job. But these are not covenant stories. They don’t concern the terms for forming a new community or nation.)

Was it mis-stated? Rousseau maybe was closer. Concept of “the general will”. Is there such a thing as “a spirit of the people”?

Contrast: JFK: “Ask what you can do for your country.” vs Reagan: “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?” The Republican program since at least 1980 has been a sustained assault on the very idea of community, of the common good. Claim: A social contract alone cannot bind a nation together. An enduring nation must be bound together by a social covenant. And in a truly democratic nation, the terms of the social covenant must be developed collaboratively, not imposed from on high. 7.1 Black thought on the U.S. social covenant "],["autonomy-self-governance-and-flourishing.html", "Chapter 8 Autonomy, Self-Governance, and Flourishing 8.1 Autonomy 8.2 Reason 8.3 Flourishing", " Chapter 8 Autonomy, Self-Governance, and Flourishing In the Enlightenment concept of the self, certain concepts are central: autonomy, or self-governance; reason; Aristotle’s concept of eudaemonia, translated as human flourishing. Epistemologically, the project adopts an empirical approach, based on observation of the senses. Revealed truths, declarations based on religious scripture, claims grounded on clerical or political authority, received traditions – these are not held to be sound bases for the discovery of knowledge about the self. The Enlightenment applies recently-emerged scientific method to questions concerning the means and ends of human life. 8.1 Autonomy Autonomy is a central concept in the Enlightenment concept of the self. Autonomy != satisfaction of desire Rather, a being with autonomy is self-governing. A being that is governed entirely by its desires and appetites is not self-governing. (Ref: Plato’s Republic.) 8.2 Reason 8.3 Flourishing A translation of Aristotle’s eudaemonia, human flourishing is the proper end of human life. It involves the realization of potential. Eudaemodia is not the same as “happiness”, and certainly not the same as pleasure, or the satisfaction of desire. When Jefferson wrote of human’s unalienable right to “the pursuit of happiness”, eudaemonia is what he had in mind.

Esp. re: religion: “God commands X; therefore, X ought to be done.” Must add the normative axiom: “God’s commands ought to be followed.” G.E. Moore: Introduced the naturalistic fallacy. Target: utilitarianism. Bentham et al. If you define “good” = “pleasure”, then you assert: meaning of good = meaning of pleasure. Then it would make no sense to ask: Q: “Is pleasure good?” But Q is an informative question. Therefore, good cannot be defined as pleasure. Called the open question argument. Involves paradox of analysis: If you give an analysis, you give meaning of things in terms of other terms. But if analysis is only matching conceptual identity, then analysis cannot generate new information. Frege: “A = A” is not informative. “A = B” is informative. But Leads to sense-reference distinction. Fundamental question: Suppose we want to say that flourishing is good. Can we ask this question? Could the answer be “No”? Could we entertain circumstances under which human flourishing is not a good thing? Hypothesis: we cannot say this. We cannot imagine any conditions under which this is false. Open Question Argument suggests: “pleasure = good” might be false. Assertion: Relationship between “flourishing” and “good” is the same as the relationship between “murder” and “immoral” / “morally unjustified”. Claim: Instances of the property of “genuine flourishing” will always be a sub-class of the property of “good”. Key question: Why is it so difficult to imagine instances of flourishing that are not good? Look for specific instances: When we see flourishing, why is it so hard to reject the assertion that this is good? 10.2 Divine Command Theory 10.3 The Problem of Moral Alienation If we affirm and follow moral laws solely because of commands (God’s or anyone’s), then we are not truly moral agents. We are a kind of animal. This problem is one for all systems that are based on a hierarchical authority, where authority relies essentially on self-interested conception of the self and application of rewards and punishments. It actually promotes a conception of the self as a self-interested being, a.k.a., homo economicus. Beef w/ salvation-oriented (salvatic?) religions: it’s ultimately based on self-interest.
