Notes on 2021-08-28

A society has *integrity* to the extent that it functions in conformance with the covenental values and ideals measured by the metric of human flourishing.

Plato & Aristotle: focus on *harmony*, defined by putting groups of people into well-defined, permanent social silos.

Integrity gestures towards harmony, w/o rigid classifications.

Also: generalize *self-interest* to *parochial interest*.

Sen, Nussbaum, Isaac Levy.

Notes from our meeting the previous week

Levi: Thinks about *commitments* to beliefs of values. Conflicts arise. How do you go about *revising* your beliefs, commitments, interests when conflicts arise? 

The principles of such revisions may be useful 
to see how a *society* that has commitments to certain values will deal with situations when those values come into (real or apparent) conflict.

PBO: Allow an individual to have multiple values, each of which can generate a ranking. Just allowing that is useful by itself, allowing derivation of interesting results regarding covenant vs contract.

(Don't even need to discuss beliefs.)

An individual is associated with one system of values.
Each of these values is associated with a way to partially rank options. A value generates a partial ranking of option. 
If an individual's value system generates conflicting ranking of options, then there arises a situation of value conflict.
