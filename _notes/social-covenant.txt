Axioms: "We hold these truths to be self-evident..."

* All human beings have rights
* These include life, liberty, and the pursuit of eudaimonia (~ happiness, flourishing, self-fulfillment)



Values, Aspirations, Guiding Principles



What's genuinely new in our Covenant, that is at-best weak in existing arrangements:

(1) *Dignity* -- individual human dignity -- is identified and highlighted as a central goal for society and a legitimate concern of government.

* It is the right of all human beings to live in dignity.

We identify a cluster of pre-conditions needed in order to make the make the promises of life, liberty, and eudaimonia *real*.
Could also see these are pre-conditions needed to support a dignified life.


These pre-conditions include:

* Healthcare
* Effective avenues for political participation
* Respectful treatment in the workplace; attention to the dignity of work
* Access to a minimum level of economic resources needed to meet basic needs including food, housing, and shelter
